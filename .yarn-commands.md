### Add dependencies

```shell
yarn add bootstrap
yarn add localtunnel -D # -D flag to devDependencies
yarn add async --peer # --peer flag to peerDependencies
yarn add async --optional # --optional flag to optionalDependencies

yarn global add nodemon # To install globally on your system
```

> Note: on package.json we can see 3 types of dependencies

- `dependencies`: These are the packages your project needs to run.
- `devDependencies`: These are the packages needed for development and testing.
- `peerDependencies`: These are the packages that your project expects to be installed by the user or by another package that your project is a dependency of.
- `optionalDependencies`: These are dependencies that your project can work without, but can use if they are installed. If an optional dependency fails to install, Yarn will still continue to install the rest of the packages and it won't cause the entire installation to fail.

## Remove dependencies

```shell
yarn global remove nodemon # to remove from yarn global packages
yarn async remove nodemon # to remove from project
```

## See dependencies

```shell
yarn global list # to see yarn global packages
```
